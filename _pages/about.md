It's me, Bowen! I am a junior in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, working on Machine Learning + Natural Language Processing. I am privileged to be part of the [LIT research group](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) and [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/), being supervised by [Rada Mihalcea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_Mihalcea), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), [Veronica Perez-Rosas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yatiIigAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Maggie Makar](https://mymakar.github.io/).

I am interested in developing culture-aware and multimodal dialogue systems that support mental health conversation. Beyond that, my long-term goal is to interpret the creative process within language models.   

Before my journey at Michigan, I grew up in [Yueyang, Hunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang). It is a beautiful city nestled by [Dongting Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongting_Lake). I am one of the rare Hunaneses who can't sustain hot spice.
